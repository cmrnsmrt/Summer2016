    Blandford training camp is the head of the army signals corps in the uk. We went there to do our level 2 and 3 signalling certificatesas i already had my level 1. We were learning how set up masts and field cables which transport signals from field phone to phone. For our level 3 we learnt all about low level encryption and radio wave transportation. We stayed in barracks which were split into male and female halfs. There were 6 of us from Dollar at the camp and i stayed in a room with one boy from Dollar and 1 boy who had travelled al the way from Wales. We al met some interesting people and made friends with most of them. We travelled by plane, train and bus. We went from Edinburgh to Southampton via plane, then took the train from Southampton to Salisbury and finally got a bus from Salisbury to the army camp. The Course consisted of Lessons from 9 am to 4pm and then a test every 2/3 days. I acheived the highest score out of all the dollar pupils from the course. My score was 75% which means i will be invited back to the next course hopefully. Achieving the highest score won me this years best signals cadet award (sorry there were no pictures but there were no phones allowed during comps)
