    The Duke of Edinburgh award is a reward which consists of several parts, volounteering, physicsal, skills and expedition. You must complete 3 months of 1 hour per week for each of theese and then an extra 3 months for one section. I have been teaching badminton for volounteerung, doing cricket for physical, R2D2 for skills and a one night unsupervised expedition for the last bit. I have completed physical, skills and volounteering and have completed my supervised practice Expedition. In September we will go into the ochils as we had already done before but without an adult where we must check in at our campsite and set up camp, cook dinner, sleep, cook breakfast, pack up and walk another 5km as we did the day before. I do my DofE because it gives me the chance of adventure and to escape everyday life.
