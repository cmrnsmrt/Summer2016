    Wellbeck is a nationwide competition to see which CCF is the best in the UK. We won this 2, 3 & 4 years ago but were not allowed to compete 1 year ago as you must take a 1 year break if you win 3 times. We came second this year. I was in the team along with several of my friends. We competed in loughburrough in England (see map). We drove there which took 5 hours and 2 coffees to keep me awake, we left at 4pm and arrived at 9pm but didnt get into our rooms until 10pm and in bed by 11:30. We stayed in a travel lodge wheras the other team bar 1 camped in a field at the college. Wellbeck is a sixth form college which teaches engineering and science. Since our last time in the competition the main focus had changed from team building and leadership to STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) but since the contents of the competition are secret we trained based on the old competition and had not trained for STEM, we came overall second and feel we did rather well. (sorry there were no pictures but there were no phones allowed during comps)
